# Mission-to-Mars

## Project Overview

The Mission to Mars WebApp was developed to scrape data from various websites using BeautifulSoup and Splinter to provide the user with the following data:

- Latest news regarding Mars provided by NASA.
- A featured Image of Mars provided by JPL at the California Institute of Technology
- An array of facts about the planet.
- Full-resolution images and titles of the four hemispheres on Mars.

The following updates were also added to improve on the design, layout, and functionality of the original WebApp: 

- "Scape New Data" button colour change to align with the theme of the red planet.
